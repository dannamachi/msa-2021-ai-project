## LEARNING SUMMARY
### What has been completed
I went through the general learning path which gave me an overview of the Azure's ability to quickly create, train and experiment with machine learning models. Leveraging cloud computing and the various Azure services, I was able to build and deploy ML models for potential use with other application without having to spend too much time learning the technical details of cloud deployment or ML pipeline. I also had a brief walkthrough of the integration of AI job roles into existing systems, which was very informative and interesting to learn about. After this, I finished the technical learning path which did not take me as much time as I've had prior experience with Python, but learning about Flask was cool as it gave me another lightweight web application framework to fall back on.

### My key takeaways
Honestly I have never attempted or even thought of deploying a machine learning model as an REST API service before, which in retrospective makes a lot of sense. Experiencing this both in the automated way (Designer) and the manual way (Azure Notebook) have been a unique experience (it was very easy in the former and a lot of pain in the latter), which has made me further appreciate the extent to which Azure has helped facilitate the deployment process with its various automated option. Seeing what is offered by Azure, I've come to realize how easy and accessible it is to create a machine learning solution, and the amount of data available via public APIs means there is great potential in using AI to enrich our life, now that it has become more simple. Something for me to try to achieve with this new knowledge would be to create another AI solution, one which can continuously evolve (actively gathering data as opposed to using static datasets) and bring more value to the world.
